🚀 # In this application we are using gRPC in mobile app, and firebase on web application.
🚀 # To run gRPC service in local:
  - Install protoc_plugin before run, check this link: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/dart/quickstart/
  - run this script in terminal: dart .\bin\server.dart 

🚀 # Run Docker
- Create the Container
- To get the container running, we first have to build an image:
  docker build -t flutter-web .

This builds an image called flutter-web and uses the current directory as the context for the Dockerfile
If everything completed successfully, we then run the container:
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name flutter-web flutter-web 

- Now, if you navigate to http://localhost:8080, you should see the flutter app.
- When you want to stop it, run:
  docker stop flutter-web
